## Summary

This MOD makes some infinite fluid resouces finite.
Supports Factorio 2.0+ (Crude oil) and Space Age (Sulfuric acid geyser and fluorine vent) for now.

## Warning

Resource parameters and mining speed of pumpjacks may change in future versions.

MODs that make resources infinite are _not_ marked as conflicts, but using such MODs with this MOD
may cause unexpected result.
